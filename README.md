# Poem-generator-from-russian-prose

Algorithm transforms prose to poem minimizing changes to the initial text. My approach is to find the most appropriate words to insert/replace words using bidirectional recurrent neural network language model and then find the best path through different options. Poems obey rhythmic and rhyme constraints.
